We are creating an Android application to collect a user’s name, email, program, a password, 
and a password confirmation. It also contains a Save button. When the user clicks the 
save button, it will display a message with the user’s name, welcoming them to the app.

We created the following functions:
setSpinnerError function that sends out an error if the spinner is empty.
Initialization function where we initialized the variables with ID names
CheckInput function that is a boolean, it makes sure the fields are not left blank
performSignUp function that displays a Welcome message including the users name
